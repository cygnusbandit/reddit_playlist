reddit_playlist
===============

Python reddit playlist maker.

I was unaware of the existence reddit.tv, so I tried to make my own using python. 
It basically makes a playlist of all the videos of a subreddit of your choice.
It has some exceptions that I was planing on fixing.
But I stopped here since there's no point on continuing it.


It is my first python project ever.
Any advice on how to make my code more "pythonic" is welcome.
